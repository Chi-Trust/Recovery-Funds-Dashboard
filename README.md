# Federal Funds Dashboard

## Description

This repository contains the code and data that power the [Federal Funds Dashboard](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/).

Federal COVID-19 pandemic response packages have provided state and local governments with unprecedented aid. The impact of these resources will directly result from how they are spent and in which communities. Given this unparalleled opportunity to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most and propel momentum toward closing the racial and ethnic wealth gap, this dashboard aims to provide transparency on where funds are landing.

The funds we tracked represent two streams of federal dollars flowing to Illinois: [economic recovery funds](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/recovery-funds.html) and [infrastructure funds](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/infrastructure-funds.html). By adding clarity around how federal funds are being disbursed locally and for what purposes, we can begin to understand and hold ourselves collectively responsible for ensuring the Chicago region recovers equitably and inclusively.  

As new data becomes available, more program allocation and spending information will be added. For more information, see our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/FAQ.html) and [Glossary](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/glossary.html).

4. Ask the Trust's representative to review the latest changes on the [staging GitHub pages deployment](https://chi-trust.github.io/Stg-Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/) for approval.
5. Once the Trust approves the changes, you can merge the PR to incorporate teh changes into the `Recovery-Funds-Dashboard` repo. This will automatically trigger a new deployment of the GitHub pages site. This may take a few minutes to update. You should check the [production GitHub pages deployment]((https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/) to ensure the update looks good once it's live.
