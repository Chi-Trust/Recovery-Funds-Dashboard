# Federal Recovery Funds Dashboard

This repository contains the code and data that power the [Federal Recovery Funds Dashboard](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/).

Federal COVID-19 pandemic-response packages have provided unprecedented aid to state and local governments, including \$800 billion that can be used flexibly to promote an inclusive recovery. These resources create an unparalleled opportunity for advocates and local decision-makers to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most, close equity gaps exacerbated by the pandemic, and address the root causes of inequities. To take advantage of this opportunity, local leaders need timely data and evidence to ensure funds are used effectively and equitably.

**This dashboard tracks a subset of the federal recovery funds flowing into the City of Chicago, Cook County, and the State of Illinois** that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts that align with key priorities of The Chicago Community Trust: community investment, community safety, household investment, housing, and workforce development, which are all vital to narrowing the Chicago region's racial and ethnic wealth gap. The dashboard primarily tracks appropriations, or how much funding the federal government has committed to provide local jurisdictions. For a few select programs where information is available, the dashboard also explores spending by zip code.

The inclusive recovery funds we track represent a subset of COVID-19 assistance provided by the federal government. The dashboard only reflects funds flowing directly from the federal government to the State of Illinois, Cook County, and the City of Chicago that can be used for inclusive recovery efforts that align with key priorities of The Chicago Community Trust: community investment, community safety, household investment, housing, and workforce development, which are all vital to narrowing the Chicago region's racial and ethnic wealth gap. It does not include funds provided by the federal government directly to public housing authorities, school districts, universities, or nongovernmental organizations, such as non-profits or private sector firms.

We will add more program allocation and spending information as new data become available. 

This project is a collaboration between [The Chicago Community Trust](https://www.cct.org/) and the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/). It is supported by a grant from the Kresge Foundation through the [Shared Prosperity Partnership](http://www.sharedprosperitypartnership.org/).
