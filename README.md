# Federal Funds Dashboard

This repository contains the code and data that power the [Federal Funds Dashboard](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/).

Federal COVID-19 pandemic response packages have provided state and local governments with unprecedented aid. The impact of these resources will directly result from how they are spent and in which communities. Given this unparalleled opportunity to ensure federal funds reach communities that need them most and propel momentum toward closing the racial and ethnic wealth gap, this dashboard aims to provide transparency on where funds are landing.

The funds we tracked represent two streams of federal dollars flowing to Illinois: [economic recovery funds](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/recovery-funds.html) and [infrastructure funds](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/infrastructure-funds.html). By adding clarity around how federal funds are being disbursed locally and for what purposes, we can begin to understand and hold ourselves collectively responsible for ensuring the Chicago region recovers equitably and inclusively.  

As new data becomes available, more program allocation and spending information will be added. For more information, see our [Frequently Asked Questions](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/FAQ.html) and [Glossary](https://chi-trust.github.io/Recovery-Funds-Dashboard/glossary.html).

This project is a collaboration between [The Chicago Community Trust](https://www.cct.org/) and the [Urban Institute](https://www.urban.org/). It is supported by a grant from the Kresge Foundation through the [Shared Prosperity Partnership](http://www.sharedprosperitypartnership.org/).
